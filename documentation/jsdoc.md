## Nutrient React Native SDK

The [Nutrient React Native SDK](https://www.nutrient.io/) is a framework that allows you to view, annotate, sign, and fill PDF forms on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Web.

[Nutrient Collaboration](https://www.nutrient.io/sdk/solutions/collaboration) adds real-time collaboration features to seamlessly share, edit, and annotate PDF documents.

This library requires a valid license of the Nutrient SDK. Licenses are per platform.

The Nutrient React Native SDK exposes the most often used APIs from Nutrient. Many of our partners end up forking this repository and adding some custom code to achieve even greater integration with their products, using native code.

Windows is not currently supported, please use the previous version [1.24.9](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/releases/tag/1.24.9) instead.

## Support, Issues and License Questions

PSPDFKit offers support for customers with an active SDK license via <https://support.nutrient.io/hc/en-us/requests/new>.

Are you evaluating our SDK? That's great, we're happy to help out! PSPDFKit is a commercial product and requires the purchase of a license key when used in production. By default, this library will initialize in demo mode, placing a watermark on each PDF and limiting usage to 60 minutes.

To purchase a license for production use, please reach out to us via <https://www.nutrient.io/sdk/contact-sales>.
